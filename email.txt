Michael,
Thanks for looping me in. I agree with Rajiv that the revised budget narrative needs clarification on the subcontractor rates. The SOW still includes references to the outdated 2022 pilot, which could raise red flags with reviewers.

Karen — can you confirm if we’re still targeting the 8/12 submission deadline?

Best,
Jessica

Thanks Jessica —
Looping you in for clarification. Rajiv raised a concern that I also flagged earlier: the SOW revision from Tom contradicts the previous scope approved in the May PI meeting. We need a clear decision on which version to proceed with.

Rajiv — can you re-forward Tom’s most recent changes? I can’t locate them in my inbox.

Best,
Michael

Michael,
Attached again — Tom’s email from Friday evening has a revised scope (v4.1) that still refers to the deprecated sensor architecture.

Jessica — do we have leeway to revert to v3.2, which was previously approved by the tech board?

Regards,
Rajiv

We are technically still targeting 8/12 but DOE has not finalized their internal review calendar. We might get a 2-day extension. I’ll update by EOD today.

Jessica — please flag any fatal inconsistencies in the current SOW before COB.

Guys,
Not sure what happened, but the version Rajiv forwarded is outdated. Use v4.3 — I sent it Sunday morning. It includes updated tech milestones and re-baselined partner contributions.

Also, the deprecated architecture language was removed in that version.

Tom —
Found v4.3, thanks. It looks fine except for Appendix B, which still references legacy partner ‘NanoTechSys’ instead of 'NTS Group' post-merger.

Jessica — will that raise issues in the interagency review?

Yes. NTIS still has the older name in SAM.gov. Use ‘NanoTechSys (d/b/a NTS Group)’ and include a footnote in the partner orgs table.

Thanks,

Tom — you’ll also need to update the LOE matrix to reflect the Q4 shift of 160 hours from hardware integration to partner liaison activities.

DOE just confirmed the 8/12 deadline is firm. No extensions. Make sure the revised files go through internal routing by tomorrow.

Tom, just saw the milestone chart still shows the June 2026 target. We moved that to Sept 2026 in the kickoff brief. Update needed?
