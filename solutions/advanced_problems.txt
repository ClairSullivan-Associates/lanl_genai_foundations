✅ Question 1: Acceptable Use Policy Snippet

Solution:
Generative AI may be used for drafting or summarizing public-facing documents, provided outputs are reviewed by a human and labeled appropriately. It must not be used with export-controlled, classified, or CUI data. Users must disclose when GenAI was used and cite sources when applicable.

✅ Question 2: Framework Comparison – GAO vs NIST RMF

Solution:
The NIST RMF is more appropriate for managing technical and operational risks within a lab environment. It offers detailed controls and processes suited to AI deployment. The GAO framework is stronger for high-level governance but lacks implementation depth.

✅ Question 3: Workflow for Implementing GenAI in Labs

Solution:

Define use case and success criteria

Assess risks (e.g., privacy, security, fairness)

Select and test GenAI tool for performance and safety

Develop review and approval process with SME involvement

Monitor outputs and document improvements iteratively

✅ Question 4: National Security Risk – Triage of Foreign Nuclear Publications

Solution:

False flags or misses → Require human-in-the-loop validation

Opaque model behavior → Use tools with explainability or traceable citations

Poor domain fit → Ground with DOE-specific retrieval or fine-tuning

✅ Question 5: Executive Briefing Agenda on M‑25‑21

Solution:

Current GenAI uses – “Which tools must be documented in our AI inventory?”

Risk and compliance – “How are we addressing data security and export control?”

Staff training and policy – “Do users know when GenAI is restricted?”

Cross-lab collaboration – “What can we learn from peer DOE sites?”
